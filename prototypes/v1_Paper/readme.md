#### Results
This design was mainly centered to be a proof of concepts for detachable
modules. All 3 of the modules; leap motion, d435i, driver board where fully
detachable with no resistance. The paper module holders where able to firmly
hold grip of the main frame. 

#### Thoughts and whats next 
As a reminder this design is in no way resemblant of the final product, that
is why we prototype. 
Here are some notes:
    - the legs of the module holders where bendable. 3D printing that functionality 
      may for 2 reasons: 1.) It can break the module 2.) It possibly imposes a limit on
      what sensors can be attached to the main frame. 

    - The main frame is too thick. The portion of the frame that latches the leap motion
      understandably needs to be thick. But having the frame be 2.5cm in height all around
      the headset is unaceptable. 

Whats next:

    - Need to figure out cable management 
    - How to make the design more thin 
    - Account for modularity of the main frame itself 
    - In what ways can we maximize comfort
